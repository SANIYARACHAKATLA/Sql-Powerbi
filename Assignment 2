  Bullets:
  1. Mean
       The mean is the average value for each attribute:
       Horsepower (105.08): Most cars have moderate horsepower,
       with a few high or low values affecting the average.
       Weight (2979.41 pounds): Cars typically weigh around 3,000 pounds, though some are notably heavier or lighter.
       Acceleration (15.52): On average, cars accelerate at about 15.5 units, reflecting moderate performance.
  2. Median
        The median is the middle value when data is ordered:
        Horsepower (95): Half of the cars have less than 95 horsepower, indicating many cars with lower horsepower.
        The higher mean suggests that a few powerful cars increase the average.
        Weight (2822.5 pounds): A lower median compared to the mean shows that lighter cars are more common,
        but heavier cars skew the average upward.
        Acceleration (15.5): The median is nearly identical to the mean, showing a balanced distribution of acceleration values.
  3. Standard Deviation (SD)
       SD reflects how spread out the data is:
       Horsepower (38.77): Thereâ€™s significant variability, meaning cars have a wide range of horsepower levels.
       Weight (847 pounds): Car weights vary greatly, with some much lighter or heavier than the average.
       Acceleration (2.80): Acceleration values are relatively consistent, with most cars close to the average of 15.5.
